Red-black trees are a specialisation of binary trees that keep themselves balanced to help ensure logarithmic runtime of its operations. In this I have implemented a red-black tree and show that its insert, delete, and contains methods run in  O(log n)  time.

Implementing and proving and experimenting with the large datasets and comparing with naive binary search tree implementation.
